So the 2019 macros I wrote are fucking terrible and I want to rewrite them. Well, some of them at least. 

Hopefully this time I'll comment them, they'll be quicker, and easier to maintain. The 2019 postprocessing macros were....really bad. The others were okay, but still could be rewritten.

I also want to write something that can also automate writing the batch files themsevles. Just read vehicle parameters/import CAD files based on a spreadsheet entry or something. And turn that into a batch file that can be executed straight from a terminal without having to fiddle with anything whatsoever with STAR. Maybe with a GUI? Could be a fun project. For now command line arguments are more than sufficient. 

Maybe this will be useful for 2020. Maybe not. 

There's a good chance these are all going to be broken while I work on them. 

Another note. Rather than supporting a million different macros, each corresponding to a specific permutation or combination of macros and maintaining backwards compataibility, I only intend on supporting a small set of macros. Make your own combinations and macro queues if you need them. 

If you want to modify these. I'd suggest using intelliJ. That's what these were written in. Except for the GUI projects, those were VS for the C#/.NET project, and pyCharm for the Python project. I don't know which one I'll actually end up writing.
